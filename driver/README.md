# Driver Stubs

For Typescript < 4.7 and legacy node systems, these stubs point to resolved versions of these export paths. This is because only in more recent node.js versions do we have full support for conditional exports. This uses the `package-json-redirects` system as described [here](https://github.com/andrewbranch/example-subpath-exports-ts-compat/tree/main/examples/node_modules/package-json-redirects).
